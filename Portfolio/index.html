        <div class="self">
            <p>Hello, My name is Becca Sweeney and I am a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, where I am working on achieving a Bachelors Degree in Creative Writing with a minor in Multimedia Communications. I was born and raised in the state of Minnesota, and in my free time I like to play video games, hang out with friends, and lately have really gotten into photography.  While I am a writer first and foremost lately I have been venturing into the world of design and exploring other areas of the creative world and leraning how a person can tell a story outside of just words on a piece of paper. </p>

        <h3>Not Alone</h3>
        <p>Here we go again, <br> I think as I hear, in the middle of the night, <br> <i>Scratch, scratch, scratch</i> <br> My dog's claws sharply scraping the floor, <br> right above my head. </i></p>
        <p><i>Scratch, scratch, scratch,</i> <br>The poor things paces some more <br> I start to get up, <br> So she's not alone. <br> When suddenly, she stops moving.</p>
        <p>I hear a tiny <i>thump</i>, <br>As she lays down. <br> Hopefully for the rest of the night. <br> Until this whole thing <br> Begins once more tomorrow.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Persisting Predation</h3>
        <p>It comes out of nowhere, <br> Feeling like a snake wrapped around my chest. <br> Squeezing me, trapping me, <br> Poisioning me with doubts. <br> Feeding on my misery.</p>
        <p>First it's just a feeling <br> Then it winds me up like a toy, <br> And lets me spiral into a panic. <br> Only to repeat the process later. <br> It is always there, lurking, <br> Watching everything, a predator stalking prey, <br> Waiting for its moment to strike. <br> It never fails to find that one moment on an otherwise perfect day. </p>
        <p>Is it trying to communicate with me, <br> To warn me of something, <br>Or is its only purpose to torment and haunt? <br>I wish it would tell me. <br> Instead it goes silent once more, <br> Waiting for its next moment to attack.</p>
